# Signal Quality Enhancement in Systematic Trading: A Machine Learning Approach to Refining Technical Indicator Signals

This repository contains the code developed for my MSc dissertation at the University of Essex, School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering.

## üìñ Project Overview

This dissertation investigates how machine learning can enhance the reliability of signals generated by the **Supertrend indicator**.  
Instead of predicting prices continuously, the framework evaluates only **decision points** when the Supertrend triggers a trading signal.

A LightGBM classifier was trained using:

- **Technical features** (volatility, momentum, volume, trend indicators)
- **Sentiment features** (news and Twitter sentiment from Bloomberg Terminal)
- **Macroeconomic features** (S&P 500 Index and VIX)

**Training period:** 2016 ‚Äì 2023  
**Testing period:** January 2023 ‚Äì July 2025

Backtesting showed that refining technical signals with machine learning significantly improved profitability, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown compared with the classical Supertrend baseline.

## ‚ú® Key Results

- **Sharpe ratio improved** from **‚Äì0.41 ‚Üí 3.59**
- **Cumulative portfolio return**: 96.8% (vs. 1.28% baseline)
- **Win rate increased** from **37.6% ‚Üí 65.4%**
- **Maximum drawdown reduced** from **‚Äì12.66% ‚Üí ‚Äì2.88%**
- **Trade count reduced**, avoiding overtrading and lowering transaction costs

## üìÇ Contents

- `main.ipynb` ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow:
  - Data preparation
  - Feature engineering
  - Signal labeling
  - Model training and baselines
  - Evaluation (classification metrics & trading performance)
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì Python dependencies required to run the notebook.
- `data/` ‚Äì Contains a **sample dataset of 10 representative stocks**.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è The full dataset (32 stocks) is not included here due to size and licensing restrictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DulajSP/ml-equity-trading-signals.git
cd ml-equity-trading-signals
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

- Open the notebook and run cells sequentially.
- The provided **sample data** (10 stocks) reproduces the workflow, but results differ from the dissertation, which used the full 32-stock dataset.
- Backtesting includes a transaction cost of **0.05% per trade** by default. This parameter is customisable in the notebook.

## üìä Data Sources

- **OHLCV stock data**: TradingView (1-hour resolution)
- **Macroeconomic indices**: S&P 500 (SPX) and CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), both at 1-hour resolution
- **Sentiment data**: Bloomberg Terminal (news and Twitter sentiment aggregates, daily frequency)
